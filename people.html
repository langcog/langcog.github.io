                Ben graduated with B.A. in Cognitive Psychology from Pitzer College before completing an M.S. in Symbolic Systems at Stanford. Before returning to Stanford for his PhD, Ben worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at Roam Analytics implementing NLP systems for medical data. Ben is primarily interested two questions: (1) What is the impact of language on cognition? (2) What is the impact of cognition on language? While the first question is concerned with *representation* -- how the information encoded in language influences the way we understand and perceive the world, the second is concerned with *design* -- how distributional properties found in natural languages emerge from local interactions between speakers and listeners. He focuses on computational approaches to these questions using tools from Bayesian cognitive modeling, agent-based simulation, and machine learning.
