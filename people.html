                I received my PhD in cognitive psychology from Princeton University in 2016, and my AB in neurobiology from Harvard College in 2010. My research seeks to understand the tools we have discovered to amplify human cognition. As a central case study, my current work seeks to understand how producing graphical representations supports communication and learning. This domain encompasses behaviors from informal sketching to formal scientific visualization, and its applications to education, user interface design, and assistive technologies. After spending the 2018-2019 academic year here at Stanford, I will be starting my own lab in the <a href="https://psychology.ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego Department of Psychology</a>.

Before returning to Stanford for his PhD, Ben worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at Roam Analytics implementing NLP systems for medical data. Ben is primarily interested two questions: (1) What is the impact of language on cognition? (2) What is the impact of cognition on language? While the first question is concerned with *representation* -- how the information encoded in language influences the way we understand and perceive the world, the second is concerned with *design* -- how distributional properties found in natural languages emerge from local interactions between speakers and listeners. He focuses on computational approaches to these questions using tools from Bayesian cognitive modeling, agent-based simulation, and machine learning.
