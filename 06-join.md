Anyone interested in joining the LangCog Lab should first get to know the research we do, for instance by reading some of our [publications](/publications/).

## Graduate Students
The Language and Cognition Lab is looking for qualified graduate student applicants. Please feel free to send an email to Mike with an introduction and a CV if you would like. In the interests of time and fairness, however, the lab policy is not to meet with prospective applicants beforehand - that's what the interview weekend is for.
<br>
Please apply directly to the Stanford Psychology program and list Mike as a faculty member you would potentially like to work with. This will ensure that the application is routed appropriately.

## Research Assistants
We have a few research assistant positions available every quarter during the academic year. No prior research experience is necessary. RAs can volunteer, receive academic credit, or be paid through Federal Work Study if eligible. One credit is equivalent to 3 hours/week of work in the lab, and preference is given to a two term commitment. Interested students should email a resume and unofficial transcript to the lab manager at langcoglab (at) stanford (dot) edu, and also fill out our online application [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LjmLzRvLwWzyLr9212-ltwcTZuIcJSoBY3NFVtIfSpI/viewform).

## Summer Interns
Each summer, we host a 10 week program where we welcome students from different departments to participate in research as summer interns. We accept non-Stanford students through the CSLI summer program and RISE. We also take Stanford students accepted from Psych Summer, HB-REX, Linguistics, Symbolic Systems, and departmental Honors Programs. These students get a stipend through their individual programs which enables them to work in our lab full time for the summer. Please see the links below to learn more information - all questions about the application process and deadlines should be directed to the programs themselves.
