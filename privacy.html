            <br><br>

            <h4>Information the Language and Cognition Lab Collects</h4>
            We obtain the <u><i>name and phone number you authorize Facebook to share with Stanford University.</i></u> We will only collect information you voluntarily provide.  We have no control over how Facebook processes your information, or if it collects additional information from you.  You should review Facebook’s privacy policy closely.
            <br><br>

            We will use your data only for the purpose of recruiting you to participate in research, in particular to notify you of surveys or research studies taking place at Stanford. 
            <br><br>

            <h4>Information the Language and Cognition Lab Shares with Third Parties</h4>
            We will not share your identifiable data with any organization outside of Stanford. The Language and Cognition Lab will never sell, rent or lease your information.
