	<p><b>Where is your lab located?</b><br />
      Our lab is located on the Stanford Campus in the main Quadrangle. Please see our <a href="http://langcog.stanford.edu/contact.html">Contact</a> page for directions and information about parking.</p>
      
    <p><b>When are you at the San Jose Children's Discovery Museum?</b><br />
    Our lab is at the CDM Wednesdays-Fridays, generally from 10am-5pm depending on researcher availability. We're located in the research room, which is nearby the Mammoth and Circles exhibits. Feel free to stop by and say hi, or find any of our researchers with a Stanford nametag!</p>
      
    <p><b>What ages are you looking for?</b><br />
    	Our <a href="http://langcog.stanford.edu/currentstudies.html">Current Studies</a> page gives some information about the studies our lab is currently recruiting for. However, the Center for Infant Studies runs a variety of studies for children ages 0-4 years. We love to hear from parents who are interested in participating, and we can contact you when we have a new study that is perfect for your child.</p>
      
      <p><b>Will I be paid to participate?</b><br />
      	We do not pay participants, but you will recieve a t-shirt or a small toy as thank you for coming into the lab, or a certificate of appreciation at the Children's Discovery Museum.</p>
        
    <p><b>What happens when I arrive?</b><br />
    	When you arrive, a researcher will greet you in our waiting room. The researcher will explain the study in detail and answer any questions you may have.	
        The researcher will then ask you to read and sign a consent form, and give you a copy to take with you. </p>
    
    <p><b>Will I be with my child during the study?</b><br />
    	Yes, you will be with your child the whole time.</p>
        
    <p><b>How long do sessions usually last?</b><br />
    	For our in-lab studies, we schedule one hour appointments, which allow plenty of time for your child to become comfortable with the lab before beginning the study. At the Children's Discovery Museum, our study lasts about 10 minutes.</p>
        
    <p><b>What if my child doesn't like the study?</b><br />
    	Most infants and children enjoy participating - we design our studies to be fun and game-like. However, you and your child are free to end the session at any time and for any reason.</p>
        
    <p><b>Will you tell me how my child has done?</b><br />
    	We are not looking at the individual performance of children in our studies and our tests are not used to diagnose or treat any type of developmental delays. 
        Rather, we are interested in overall trends of a particular group. 
        Therefore we will not able to tell you how your child fared individually, but once the study is completed we can tell you what children of your child's age tend to do.
        We will update our website with recent findings and can alert you when we post findings for a study you and your child have participated in.</p>
