# Our Commitment to Openness

We believe that [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science") practices are a critical part of scientific progress. Accordingly, we are committed to releasing code, data, and materials for our research by default and whenever possible. PDF links on the publications page are typically accompanied by a link to the related github repository for materials. If you are looking for materials, code, or data but do not find them, please contact us.<br>
For more project code and the most up-to-date materials (including on unpublished projects), please see our [lab github page](http://github.com/langcog). Our  videos are hosted through a [databrary](https://nyu.databrary.org/party/258) page.<br>
In addition, we have created several tools for browsing open data repositories related to our projects:<br>
<!--  <p>Materials are listed according to the publication date of corresponding articles. </p> -->
* [Wordbank](http://wordbank.stanford.edu), an interactive database of children's vocabulary growth across languages (using data from MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory forms)
* [MetaLab](http://metalab.stanford.edu), interactive meta- and meta-meta-analysis tools for child language
* [WordBirths](http://wordbirths.stanford.edu),  visualization of data from the Human Speechome Project

The remainder of this page hosts permanent materials links for older projects.
